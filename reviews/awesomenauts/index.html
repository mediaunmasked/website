<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Awesomenauts is a great entry-level MOBA, or action-RTS (real time strategy), game but it’s also really fun for those familiar with the genre. There are about 20 characters that are relatively limited when compared to other MOBA games like DOTA 2 or Leage of Legends. Each game is relatively short (about 20-30 minutes), depending on the competition on each team. It’s a tug-of-war style game where your goal is to take out the enemy’s turrets and then base while also fighting off their AI minions and 3 other players. The cartoonish style might not be for everyone, but it all fits together and has a unique approach, which is what is important. Simple at its core, Awesomenauts is a great action-RTS for both beginners and experts. For $10 or less (I paid $2 when it was on sale), it’s well worth a try!</p>
