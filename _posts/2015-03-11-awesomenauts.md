If you don't have much time to play as many video games as you'd like, this game is a good _pick up and play one game_ style of game. It's easy to play one match and not be addicted. That doesn't mean it can't be addicting if you let it. The playerbase is rather small compared to other MOBA styled games, but that can be a nice thing. You'll occasionally see some familiar names that you can later team up with and have some fun!

> Awesomenauts is a fun, stylish, and easy-to-learn 2D MOBA.

### Overview

Awesomenauts is a great entry-level MOBA, or action-RTS (real time strategy), game but it's also really fun for those familiar with the genre. There are about 20 characters that are relatively limited when compared to other MOBA games like DOTA 2 or Leage of Legends. Each game is relatively short (about 20-30 minutes), depending on the competition on each team. It's a tug-of-war style game where your goal is to take out the enemy's turrets and then base while also fighting off their AI minions and 3 other players. The cartoonish style might not be for everyone, but it all fits together and has a unique approach, which is what is important. Simple at its core, Awesomenauts is a great action-RTS for both beginners and experts. For $10 or less (I paid $2 when it was on sale), it's well worth a try!
