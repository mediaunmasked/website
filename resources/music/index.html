<title>List of sites for royalty free music and sound effects</title>
<meta name="description" content="Good music and sound design can make or break any video. If you’ve got good video, but bad audio, your video probably won’t do as well as if you had great audio and mediocre video. It’s vital to get the perfect audio track and sound effects in your video. However, it can be hard filtering through all the options there are available online, so I created a list of royalty free music, songs, and sound effects that you can use in your own production.The following is a collective list of all the sites I’ve found that offer music and sound effects for video production (home made youtube videos or more professional). They are in no specific order. Most of them are royalty free and require no attribution, but there are some that do require specific details, so be sure to read the licensing details for each site before you use it for commercial (or noncommerical) purposes.Royalty Free Music                    Youtube                                                    Style: Calm and easy for voice over and miscellaneous videos.                          That's right, Youtube's new audio library is specifically designed for creators in mind of both video and music. So if you're looking to make a video with some free music, you can choose from the library. Although not many songs are in it right now, music makers can upload their work to add to the project.                                  TheFatRat (On YouTube)                                                    Style: Remix                          TheFatRat is one of my new favorite resources for some royalty free music. Some of the songs do get caught by youtube's copyright detection system, however (since they're remixes).                                  Goblins From Mars                                                    Style: Dubstep.                          Another great source of royalty free, creative commons dubstep is Goblins From Mars. You can listen to their stuff on YouTube and most of the videos have direct download links.

They offer some quality music, but they're not all free. There are some free songs, but others can cost anywhere from $5 to $10.

<meta property="og:description" content="Good music and sound design can make or break any video. If you’ve got good video, but bad audio, your video probably won’t do as well as if you had great audio and mediocre video. It’s vital to get the perfect audio track and sound effects in your video. However, it can be hard filtering through all the options there are available online, so I created a list of royalty free music, songs, and sound effects that you can use in your own production.The following is a collective list of all the sites I’ve found that offer music and sound effects for video production (home made youtube videos or more professional). They are in no specific order. Most of them are royalty free and require no attribution, but there are some that do require specific details, so be sure to read the licensing details for each site before you use it for commercial (or noncommerical) purposes.Royalty Free Music                    Youtube                                                    Style: Calm and easy for voice over and miscellaneous videos.

Some of the songs do get caught by youtube's copyright detection system, however (since they're remixes).

        <p>Good music and sound design can make or break any video. If you’ve got good video, but bad audio, your video probably won’t do as well as if you had great audio and mediocre video. It’s vital to get the perfect audio track and sound effects in your video. However, it can be hard filtering through all the options there are available online, so I created a list of royalty free music, songs, and sound effects that you can use in your own production.</p>

<p>The following is a collective list of all the sites I’ve found that offer music and sound effects for video production (home made youtube videos or more professional). They are in no specific order. Most of them are royalty free and require no attribution, but there are some that do require specific details, so be sure to read the licensing details for each site before you use it for commercial (or noncommerical) purposes.</p>
